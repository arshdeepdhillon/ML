Confusion Matrix:
	* Is a 2x2 matrix that compares the actual class which can be positive or 
	   negative. It can have positive or negative output called the Predicted 
	   Class.
	   
Recall:
	True Positive / (True Positive + False Negative)
	
	* Out of all the items that are truly positive, how many were correctly
	   classified as positive. Or simply, how many positive items were 
	   'recalled' from the dataset.

Precision: 
	True Positive / (True Positive + False Positive)
	
	* Out of all the items labeled as positive, how many truly belong to the
	   positive class.	   
	   
	   
	   
					Condition: A        Not A
