Margin: Maximizes distance to nearest point of the two classes
		* To maximize the robustness (margin)
		* SVM first puts the correct classification of the labels and then
		   maximizes the margin
		* Ignores outliers 
		
Parameters of SVM: kernel, C, gamma
	C:	Controls trade off between SMOOTH DECISION BOUNDARY and CLASSIFYING 
		 TRAINING POINTS CORRECTLY
		   
		* A low C makes the decision surface smooth, while a high C aims at 
		  classifying all training examples correctly by giving the model 
		  freedom to select more samples as support vectors.
	
	gamma: low values - even the far points are taken into consideration for drawing the line 
		   far values - the close points are taken into consideration for drawing the line 
		   
		   * Defines how far the influence of a single training example reaches
		   
	
By tuning C and training on a large dataset we should get a fairly optimized result.
