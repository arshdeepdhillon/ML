It uses bunch of decision trees to choose the final answer
	* eg: Using 1000x DT, each tree gives its prediction then 
		   the final answer is selected by majority voting.
	
Random Forest is a collections for decision trees. They are also 
 known as Ensemble ML Algo which use divide and concur approach to 
 increase performance  .


Pros: When we have more trees in the forest it won't over fit.
Cons: It doesn't predict beyond the range of train data and it 
	   may over fit data sets that are noisy.
	  
	  You have very little control what the model does.
