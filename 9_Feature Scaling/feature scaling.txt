Feature Scaling:
	is a method for re-scaling features so they range between [0,1]. The original information will stay the same.	

	* Itâ€™s a type of feature preprocessing that you should perform before 
	   some classification and regression tasks.
	   
	   
	x'    = new (rescaled) feature
	x	  = is the old value of the individual feature that you're rescaling   	
	x_min = are taken by from the old feature before it was rescaled
	x_max = are taken by from the old feature before it was rescaled
	
	
	x' = (x - x_min) / (x_max - x_min)
