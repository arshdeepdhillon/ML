The goal of any supervised machine learning algorithm is to achieve low bias and low variance.

Variance 
	is the amount that the estimate of the target function will change 
	 if different training data was used.
	
	* The target function is estimated from the training data by a machine 
	   learning algorithm, so we should expect the algorithm to have some 
	   variance. Ideally, it should not change too much from one training 
	   dataset to the next, meaning that the algorithm is good at picking 
	   out the hidden underlying mapping between the inputs and the output 
	   variables.
	   
	   
	Low Variance: Suggests small changes to the estimate of the target 
				   function with changes to the training dataset.
				   
	High Variance: Suggests large changes to the estimate of the target 
				   function with changes to the training dataset.
				   
Bias
	are the simplifying assumptions made by a model to make the target function easier to learn.
	
	* Generally, parametric algorithms have a high bias making them fast to learn and easier to 
	   understand but generally less flexible. In turn, they have lower predictive performance on 
	   complex problems that fail to meet the simplifying assumptions of the algorithms bias.

	Low Bias: Suggests less assumptions about the form of the target function.
	High-Bias: Suggests more assumptions about the form of the target function.
