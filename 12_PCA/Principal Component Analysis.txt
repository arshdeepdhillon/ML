PCA (Principal Component Analysis):
	* PCA finds new coordinate system that's obtained from the old one by
	   translation and rotation only.
	* PCA finds a coordinate system that centers itself in the data and aligns
	   the x axis with the principle axis of variation.
	   
	  
Advantages of Maximal Variance:
	When doing compression:
		* When we project along the dimension of the largest variance this
		   retains the maximum amount of information in the original data.
	   
When you use PCA:
	* Latent features driving the patterns in the data.
	* Dimensionality reduction
		* It helps you visualize high dimensional data
		* Reduce noise
		* make other algorithms work better because fewer inputs
